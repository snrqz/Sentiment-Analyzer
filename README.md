# Sentiment Analyzer

Welcome to the Sentiment Analyzer! As the name suggests, this tool allows you to input text and receive a sentiment analysis based on AI models. While I've built and tested my own model, it unfortunately has a low accuracy rate, so it isn't currently in use—but you're welcome to improve upon it!

## Overview
This project leverages machine learning models built on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiment of a given text. In addition to a custom-built model, the project includes a more accurate pre-trained model for better results. Despite the challenges, the custom model demonstrates the foundational work and is included for educational purposes.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.x**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed to run or modify the code.
- **IDE/Text Editor**: Use an appropriate IDE (like PyCharm, VSCode) or a basic text editor to view and edit the code.
- **Optional Challenge**: Feel free to extend or refine this project. Whether you're aiming to improve accuracy, incorporate additional features, or even build your own sentiment analysis system from scratch, this repository is a great starting point.

## Running the Analyzer
1. **Run the Main Script**:
    ```bash
    python analyze_sentiment.py
    ```
2. **Input Text**:
   - You’ll be prompted to input a text string. The analyzer will output the detected sentiment (sad, joy, love, anger, fear, surprise).

## Contributing
If you're interested in enhancing this project, contributions are highly welcome! Whether it's refining the existing model, adding new features, or improving the codebase, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.

Dive in, explore, and perhaps even take on the challenge of building a better sentiment analyzer!
